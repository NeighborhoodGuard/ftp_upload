# This file supplies configuration info for the FTP_Upload unit tests and for
# FTP_Upload itself during testing.  Only the first four items below should
# need to be changed to adapt to a given test setup.  The remaining config
# items are either simple constants or derived values used by the tests or
# by ftp_upload.py.
#

#
# the full path on the local machine of the FTP login directory of the
# test FTP user
#
ftp_login_path = /home/testuser

# the relative path from the ftp_login_path above to the top-level directory
# on the testing machine under which the directories for the incoming and 
# processed files, and the simulated cloud server FTP directory will be
# located.  The testing code tacitly assumes all three of these
# directories will be under the same parent directory on the test machine.
# If this top-level directory is the directory specified in the ftp_login_path,
# set the ftp_testing_dir to "." (no quotes)
#
ftp_testing_dir = ftp_upload_test


# the user name and password for the FTP testing account
#
ftp_username = testuser_name
ftp_password = testuser_password

###
# Generally speaking, the values below this point should not need to be changed
# for testing
###
