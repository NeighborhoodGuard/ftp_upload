#FTP_Upload#

###Summary###

FTP_Upload is part of a software suite from [Neighborhood Guard](http://neighborhoodguard.org) to upload images from IP cameras and organize them into Web pages for easy access and review.

FTP_Upload is an application written in Python intended run on a machine local to one or more IP cameras.  The camera(s) upload  images to this local machine either via FTP or by using it as a network share.  The local machine acts as a buffer to offload the camera images quickly, then copy them upstream to a server elsewhere on the Internet, as upstream bandwidth and server availability permit.

The FTP_Upload software takes care of transferring these image files to the server via FTP, then deleting them from the local machine once they have been successfully transferred and an expiration period has elapsed.
